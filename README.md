# pyhotkeys

Dependencies you can install with pip:
> pyautogui, keyboard, tkinter

If you don't have it,
> pip install pyinstaller 

Otherwise,

Then just run the executable. 

You also can just run it in pycharm or whichever environment you're in if you're used to doing that.

You can start and stop the hotkeys running with F1
